# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
1. random subset of people were infected
infected_indices = np.random.choice(ppl.index, size=int(len(ppl) * ATTACK_RATE), replace=False)
the sampling frame is the dataframe with all the peoples, separated by wedding or brunch (ppl.index, each individual has a unique index number and clustered based on attended a wedding or a brunch). Sampling randomly with the np.random.choice from a uniform distribution (without replacement). The sampling size is 10% infected (attack_rate). 
These relate to the blog post section on 10% chance of being infected, so on average 10% of the population is infected.

2. randomly decide which infected people are traced
ppl.loc[ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = np.random.rand(sum(ppl['infected'])) < TRACE_SUCCESS
the sampling frame is all the infected people from the previous sampling event. np.random.rand sampling randomly within the infected subset. Uniform without replacement still. The sampling size is trace_success = 20% of infected people. 
These relate to the blog post section on contact tracing, but the way we did it is independent of the event. which is why our graph looks more representative of all the infections, unlike the blog post. 

The code does not reproduce the graphs from the original blog post as the frequency of infections from weddings is higher in the code than in the blog post, and it has a smaller variance.

When the simulations are decreased to 100, its less reproducible (law of numbers from the lectures). I increased the number of iterations to 100,000. This made the graph reproducible due to the law of large numbers, we're more likely to get the true average of the population the more averages we take (more repetitions).
